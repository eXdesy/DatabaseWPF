# 💻 WPF Interface BaseDateThis project is a desktop application developed in C# using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The application provides a graphical user interface to interact with a MySQL database. It allows performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database tables, as well as executing custom queries.<p align="center">  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/8.0.33" target="_blank">    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MySql.Data-8.3.0-blue" alt="MySql.Data 8.3.0" />  </a>  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/4.8.6" target="_blank">    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/System.Data.SqlClient-4.8.6-lightgrey" alt="System.Data.SqlClient 4.8.6" />  </a>  <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/" target="_blank">    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/IDE-Visual%20Studio%202022-purple" alt="Visual Studio 2022" />  </a></p>## 🔐 1. **LoginWindow**Represents the login window of the application. After entering the correct credentials, a connection to the database is established and the main window (`MainWindow`) is opened.![LoginWindow](https://github.com/eXdesy/DataBaseWPF/blob/master/img/LoginWindow.png)## 🧭 2. **MainWindow**Represents the main window of the application. It displays a menu with the available database tables and allows navigation between them. It also provides functionality to close the database connection.![MainWindow](https://github.com/eXdesy/DataBaseWPF/blob/master/img/MainWindow.png)## 📊 3. **TableWindow**Represents the window that displays the data of a specific database table. It allows performing CRUD operations on the data and executing custom queries.![TableWindow](https://github.com/eXdesy/DataBaseWPF/blob/master/img/TableWindow.png)  ![TableWindow2](https://github.com/eXdesy/DataBaseWPF/blob/master/img/TableWindow2.png)## 🧪 Application Usage1. When the application starts, the login window (`LoginWindow`) is shown. Enter the database credentials and press the "Enter" button to establish the connection.2. Once connected, the main window (`MainWindow`) will open, showing a menu with the available tables. Select a table to view and manage its data.3. In the table window (`TableWindow`), you can perform CRUD operations on the selected table's data. There are also predefined buttons to execute specific queries, such as displaying the best-selling products.4. To log out and return to the login window, press the "EXIT" button in the main window (`MainWindow`).## 🛠 Requirements- MySQL Server installed and running.- A valid database connection with the appropriate credentials.## ⚙️ Installation and Execution- Download the repository.- Configure the MySQL server as follows:    - Connection method: `Standard (TCP/IP)`    - Host name: `127.0.0.1`    - Port: `3306`    - Username: At your discretion.    - Password: At your discretion.- Launch the application in Visual Studio.- Log in.## 📦 Dependencies- The application uses the `MySql.Data` library to connect to and manipulate the MySQL database.## 📝 Notes- Make sure you have an active database connection before performing any CRUD operations or queries.- The application provides a simple graphical interface to interact with the database, but understanding the underlying database structure is necessary for effective use.## 👨‍💻 AuthorsCreated and developed by DILYORBEK MUKHIDDINOV and ERIC QUILES SILGADO for the second term project of the *Multiplatform Application Development* course at *Instituto Santa Joaquina de Vedruna* during the 2023/2024 academic year.
